# So you want to help build Xethya?

That's awesome! We're glad you're joining us :smile: The idea of this meta-repo is to keep an eye on the project's agenda, as well as help newcomers in their quest for pull-requesting. Happy coding!

### Technical aspects

#### :package: Flexible and composable

One of the main goals of Xethya is to be as flexible and composable as possible. Therefore, every component is a stand-alone Node package.

#### :stars: Universal

Xethya should run anywhere where JavaScript can run. So, that means both server-side and client-side. Unless the feature's scope is specifically the browser (i.e. audio management), we should attempt to write as universal as possible JavaScript code.

#### :file_folder: Scaffolding

We use the `javascript` generator from `yeoman`, so we have Babel + Rollup already baked in. If a better alternative is out there and you know about it, feel free to suggest it.

### Specifications

The full specification of the framework is being written in the [xethya/.specs](https://github.com/xethya/.specs) repo. If you come from the RPG world, consider this repo the Dungeon Master's Gamebook.

This repo is your starting point if you're becoming a _Feature Champion_. Let's go with an example:

> Meet Vilma ðŸ™‹. Vilma is a JavaScript developer that wants to join Xethya. She's an expert in [PRNGs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudorandom_number_generator) and wants to implement new randomization algorithms in the [Dice](https://github.com/xethya/xethya-dice) module. She wants more _aggresive_ rolls, so she starts writing down how the dice should behave in [xethya/.specs](https://github.com/xethya/.specs). For that, she opens an issue to submit a proposal. The proposal spec is discussed and once that the _Guild_ resolves where should the feature live, coding begins. 

[_The Guild_](https://github.com/orgs/xethya/teams/guild) is the team of core contributors of Xethya.

### Roadmap

We'll keep track of the framework's global status with GitHub issues and [projects](https://github.com/xethya/.roadmap/projects) contained in this repo.
